# Iris_exploration
Explores the classic Iris dataset using Python. It includes data loading, inspection, and visualization techniques to understand feature relationships, distributions, and detect outliers. Visual tools like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots were used for meaningful insights

## 🎯 Objective
Explore and visualize the Iris dataset to understand feature relationships, distributions, and potential outliers.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Built-in `seaborn` dataset (`sns.load_dataset('iris')`)
- **Rows:** 150
- **Features:** Sepal length/width, petal length/width, species

## 🧠 Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset using Pandas and Seaborn
2. Inspected structure with `.info()` and `.describe()`
3. Created visualizations:
   - **Scatter plot**: Petal length vs width by species
   - **Histograms**: Distribution of all numerical features
   - **Box plots**: Outlier detection and species comparison

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python 3.9
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📝 Insights
- Petal measurements are great for species classification
- Distributions are clean and mostly balanced
- Outliers are minimal, dataset is clean
